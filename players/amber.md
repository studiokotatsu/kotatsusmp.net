Amber Arakada is a Soul Witch Vtuber that enjoys VR and Technology. She is loveable and entertaining, but she  can be too hyper sometimes.

She is a Catgirl that is addicted to Souls Bucks; Coffee but with souls.

On Kotatsu SMP she lives on her Cozy Cove, trying to build a nice comfy village with a nice house with a nice view of a sunset

Her "Vanilla" client has more mods than most modded players, trying to make it as eye-candy filled as possible.

She plans on making more Farms and such for everyone to use in the server.
